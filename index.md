[![Download Now](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Click%20Here-brightgreen)](https://github.com/kalaiarasi-tech/ria-fast-shutdown-sim/releases)

## 📖 Overview

The **ria-fast-shutdown-sim** is a Python-based simulator designed to validate a rapid shutdown for Reactivity-Initiated Accidents (RIA) in high-burnup nuclear fuel. This tool helps ensure that safety measures are effective by running simulations. It checks whether shutdown times are quick and does not block operations while completing. The software generates results in CSV or JSON formats and provides visual data in plots.

## ✔️ Features

- Simulates reactivity-initiated accidents with fast, orchestrated shutdowns.
- Validates worth-vs-time targets.
- Ensures shutdown occurs within 500 µs without blocking.
- Outputs results in CSV and JSON formats.
- Generates plots for easy data visualization.
- Integrates Continuous Integration (CI) practices for reliable updates.
